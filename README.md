## Scenes
### Winter 1805
1. [Old State House](statehouse1.md)
1. [The Fisherman's Haul Providence RI](fishermansHaul1.md)

### I wrote this for 3rd edition Masquerade, so unless the group decides and pushes for something else, that's where character gen and rules are. with the following in mind.

## Characters [Cast of Characters](coc.md)
- Ghouls, Vampires, Thralls. No revenants. 

## Concept
A concept is when you want to play a theif, a debutante, a white-knight, playing someone that wants to grab power, or someone that has a hidden secret to keep.
- Finally, the list of clans below require very little extra backstory to be in the area.

## Clans
At this time, Boston is mostly a Camarilla city. but there isn't enough of it to truly be a Camarilla stronghold.

    1. Blue bloods, kings and king makers. The Ventrue are born and raised to rule. 
1. Toreador
