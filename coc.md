## PC's
* Oliver King
  * A shipping merchant's son Oliver lived his life better than most, but not the life he wanted. That of the wealthy nobles and businessmen he looked up to. Even at a young age, he knew his father could never amass the fortunes, or the business that would be needed to move Oliver into the lifestyle  he wanted, so he acted. Slowly at first by creating connections and deals with people in power, people with money. Once he got the taste of the money and power he longed for, the acceptance to the circles he only wished of joining, he wanted more. 
  * Oliver is a young man in his early twenties. He's of an athletic build with brown hair, and an ever present 5 o'clock shadow. He has dark gray eyes, like those of a violent storm. Oliver exudes an air of confidence and determination. He's always found well put together, his appearance being something tied closely with his outward personality.
